# skintech_be
This is a project geared towards identifying the need within the medical practitioners in Nigeria for quick access to diagnose skin diseases and conditions. In most cases, medical doctors without knowledge about skin diseases, defer patients' cases to dermatologists. On the other hand, the number of dermatologists in Nigeria is limited and they likewise do not have a central place for skin data. This will serve as a platform for submitting for collection of skin data.

This project is part of my plan to explore backend engineering and fullstack development using golang
